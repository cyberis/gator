# Gator

A multi-player command line tool for aggregating RSS feeds and viewing the posts.

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/) installed as well as a local Postgres database. You can then install `gator` with:

```bash
go install ...
```

## Config

Create a `.gatorconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://username:@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable",
  "refresh_at_mins": 10
}
```

Replace the values with your database connection string and how often you want to refresh feed.

## Usage

Create a new user:

```bash
gator register <name>
```

Add a feed:

```bash
gator addfeed <url>
```

Start the aggregator:

```bash
gator agg 30s
```

View the posts:

```bash
gator browse [--usage] [limit] [offset]
```

There are a few other commands you'll need as well:

- `gator login <name>` - Log in as a user that already exists
- `gator users` - List all users
- `gator feeds` - List all feeds
- `gator follow <url>` - Follow a feed that already exists in the database
- `gator unfollow <url>` - Unfollow a feed that already exists in the database

## TO DO
- [ ] Add sorting and filtering options to the browse command
- [ ] Add pagination to the browse command
- [ ] Add concurrency to the agg command so that it can fetch more frequently
- [ ] Add a search command that allows for fuzzy searching of posts
- [ ] Add bookmarking or liking posts
- [ ] Add a TUI that allows you to select a post in the terminal and view it in a more readable format (either in the terminal or open in a browser)
- [ ] Add an HTTP API (and authentication/authorization) that allows other users to interact with the service remotely
- [ ] Write a service manager that keeps the agg command running in the background and restarts it if it crashes
